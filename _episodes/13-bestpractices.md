# HPC best practices

- Be friends with the file system.
- Calibrate your jobs, like you would do with an experimental apparatus
  - Use a test case where you know what the correct answer should be.
- Keep all files associated with a project in a single folder.
- Perform parallel scaling tests of your jobs.
- Include all relevant information when you send in a support request.


# Getting help

- `man` pages
  - `$ man <some-command>`
- List of good resources:
  - [An HPC wiki for another HPC center containing tutorials](https://dccn-hpc-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
  - [HPC Carpentry](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/).
  - [SNIC knowledge base with a list of training events](http://docs.snic.se/wiki/Training).
  - [List of software installed on SNIC centres along with links to documentation (poorly maintained)](http://docs.snic.se/wiki/Software).
- Send in a support request.
  - SNIC (and other national HPC providers) employs support staff and application experts who can help with basic and advanced problems.
