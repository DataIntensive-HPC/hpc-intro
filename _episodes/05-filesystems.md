# File systems at PDC

When working on a PDC cluster, you will be interacting with two different file systems. 
The differing properties of the two systems are important to understand in order make the most out 
of PDC's resources.

## Andrew File System

- AFS is a (globally) distributed file system accessible to any running AFS client.
- Your main home directory is on AFS: `/afs/pdc.kth.se/home/[initial]/[username]`
- Access to your AFS home directory is enabled by your Kerberos ticket, and the *AFS token* generated by it.

## Lustre file system (klemming)

- Nicknamed *klemming* at PDC.
- Lustre is an open-source massively parallel distributed file system.
- Very high performance (5PB storage - 130GB/s bandwidth).
- PDC users have two klemming directories:
  - `/cfs/klemming/nobackup/[initial]/[username]`: used for running jobs, input, output...
  - `/cfs/klemming/scratch/[initial]/[username]`: used for temporary files (old files get deleted).
- High file access speed, but performance deteriorates for many (~10<sup>5</sup>) small files.

## Differences between AFS and Lustre

- AFS home directories are backed up every day (lost files can be retrieved!) - Lustre is not backed up.
- AFS is *not accessible* to compute nodes on Beskow. All jobs must run on Lustre.
- AFS has limited usage quota, typically 5 GB per user - no quota is enforced on Lustre.
- Lustre is a high-performance file system - AFS is slow.
- Lustre supports standard (POSIX) Access Control Lists (ACLs) - AFS has own implementation of ACLs.
