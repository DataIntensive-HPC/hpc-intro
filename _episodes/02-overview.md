# What is high performance computing

> High Performance Computing most generally refers to the practice of aggregating computing power in 
> a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or
> workstation in order to solve large problems in science, engineering, or business.  
> (G.Sravanthi *et al.*, IOSR J. Comp. Eng. 16, 36-43)

Using a cluster often has the following advantages for researchers:

- **Speed.** With many more CPU cores, HPC systems can offer significant speed up.
- **Volume.** Many HPC systems have both the processing memory (RAM) and disk storage to handle very large amounts of data. Terabytes of RAM and petabytes of storage are available for research projects.
- **Efficiency.** Many HPC systems operate a pool of resources that are drawn on by a many users. In most cases resources are used almost constantly.
- **Cost.** Bulk purchasing and government funding mean that the cost to the research community for using these systems is significantly less than it would be otherwise.
- **Convenience.** Maybe your calculations just take a long time to run or are otherwise inconvenient to run on your personal computer. There's no need to tie up your own computer for hours when you can use someone else's instead.


## What is a cluster?

The words "cloud", "cluster", and "high-performance computing" get thrown around a lot. So what do
they mean exactly? And more importantly, how do we use them for our work?

- *Cloud* refers to remote computing resources of any kind.
  - Webservers, remote storage, API endpoints, and more traditional "compute" resources.
- *Cluster* describes a network of computers sharing a common purpose.
  - Used to accomplish tasks that might otherwise be too big for any one computer.

## What is HPC used for?

### Molecular dynamics

The simulation of molecules and their interactions are a cornerstone
in biomolecular and materials science research.  Molecular dynamics
(MD) is a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical
movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are allowed
to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the dynamic
"evolution" of the system. In the most common version, the
trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined by numerically
solving Newton's equations of motion for a system of interacting
particles, where forces between the particles and their potential
energies are often calculated using interatomic potentials or
molecular mechanics force fields.

### Electronic structure

In quantum chemistry, electronic structure is the state of motion of
electrons in an electrostatic field created by stationary nuclei, and
is described by a quantum mechanical wave function.  Electronic
structure is obtained by solving quantum mechanical equations for a
fixed nuclear geometry.  Electronic structure problem is routinely
solved with quantum chemistry computer programs. Electronic structure
calculations rank among the most computationally intensive tasks in
all scientific calculations. For this reason, quantum chemistry
calculations take up significant shares on many scientific
supercomputer facilities.

### Climate modeling

Numerical Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the
interactions of the important drivers of climate, including
atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety
of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to
projections of future climate.

### Fluid dynamics

In physics and engineering, fluid dynamics is a subdiscipline of fluid
mechanics that describes the flow of fluidsâ€”liquids and gases. It has
several subdisciplines, including aerodynamics (the study of air and
other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in
motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including
calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow
rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns,
understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission
weapon detonation.

### Brain simulation

The human brain is extremely complex. One method to help us understand
the brain is to use supercomputers to simulate parts of the brain
based on biological descriptions of brain cells. In the future it may
be possible to design computers that are based on principles similar
to how the brain works.

### Deep learning

Advances in hardware, in particular GPU technology, have lead to a
revolution in deep learning. In particular, GPUs are well-suited for
the matrix/vector computations involved in machine learning
algorithms, speeding up training algorithms by orders of magnitude.

## The future of HPC

In our increasingly computerized world, there are many reasons to
expect that the importance of HPC in many different sectors will only
grow.

The competition between supercomputer hardware vendors is stiff. Intel Xeon processors have long
dominated the HPC processor market, but now Arm has entered the race, and AMD is re-entering the market.
At the same time, thanks to the hype around big data and artificial intelligence,
there is a large focus on developing specialized hardware (e.g. GPUs, TPUs) to handle such tasks 
efficiently. 

The [TOP500 list](https://top500.org/) ranks the 500 fastest supercomputers in the world, and 
the [GREEN500](https://top500.org/green500/) list ranks the top 500 supercomputers by energy efficiency.
There is considerable prestige involved in reaching the #1 spot, which is frequently 
held by the US or China. Lately, a lot of attention is focused on developing the first 
[exascale computing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing), capable of reaching at 
least one exaFLOP. The US and China are expected to build their first exascale supercomputers in 
2020-2021, and in many ways the race to get there first reminds of the [space race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race)!
