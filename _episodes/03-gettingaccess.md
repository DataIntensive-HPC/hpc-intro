questions:
  - "How can I get an account at PDC?"
  - "How can I get an allocation of computing time?"
objectives:
  - "Understand how computing time allocations work."
keypoints:
  - "Time allocations fall into three categories: small, medium and large."
---

**In order to use PDC resources, you need**
- A PDC account.
- An allocation for PDC compute time.

## Accounts

There are two ways to apply for a PDC account:
- Via the SUPR portal, [supr.snic.se](https://supr.snic.se/).
  - This is for all SNIC-managed projects.
  - Valid post address required for sending password.
- Via PDC [application form](https://www.kth.se/form/pdc-user-account-request).
  - This is for courses and special accounts (PRACE, Scania, ...).
  - Valid post address and scan of passport required.

## Allocations

Almost all computing time allocations (except for courses) are managed in SUPR.

There are three categories of time allocations.

**Small allocations**
- Applicant can be a PhD student or more senior.
- Evaluated on a technical level only.
- Limit is usually 5,000 corehours per month.

**Medium allocations**
- Applicant must be a senior scientist in Swedish academia.
- Evaluated on a technical level only.
- On large clusters: up to 200,000 corehours per month.

**Large allocations**
- Applicant must be a senior scientist in Swedish academia.
- Need evidence of successful work at a medium level.
- Evaluated on a technical and scientific level.
- Proposal evaluated by SNAC twice a year.


|        |  **Small allocation**     | **Medium allocation**  |  **Large allocation**      |
| ---------------------- | :-----------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------: |
**Limit**                    |  5K corehours/month       |  200K corehours/month  | Above 200K corehours/month |
**Applicant requirement**    |  PhD student or higher    | Senior scientist (Assistant professor or higher) | Senior scientist (Assistant professor or higher) |
**Application evaluation**   | Technical evalaluation | Technical evaluation      | Scientific and technical evaluation by SNAC twice a year. Evidence of successful work on a medium allocation. |
